Explain the representation of signed integer values using the two's \ncomplement representation.\n\n\n(a) Which range of values can be covered with an n-bit two's complement\nrepresentation?\n\n\n\n(b) What are the advantages of using two's complement compared to other\ntypes of signed integer value representations (e.g. one's complement)?\n\n\nThe two's complement representation can represent one more number with the\nsame amount of bits, because zero is well defined.\nIt simplifies arithmetic operations.\n\n\n(c) What is arithmetic overflow and how do you detect it?\n\nAn arithmetic overflow occurs when a number is to small or too big to represent\nit with a certain amount of bits. For example:\nOne can only represent integers ranging from -128 to 127 in two's complement\nrepresentation. That means that adding 1 to the integer 127 results in an \noverflow. This overflow can be detected by just looking at the highest order\nbit which flips in this case.\n\n(d) How can you tell in two's complement representation that a number is\npositive/negative or even/odd?\n\nThe sign of a number can be recognized by looking at the highest order bit. \nIf this is bit is zero, then the number is positive. If it is one, then the\nnumber is negative.\nTo tell if a number is even or odd, one can look at the lowest order bit. An\ninteger is even if this bit is zero and odd if it is one.\n","id":"https://courses.hilgers.dev/computer-architecture/exercise01/twos-complement/","title":"1.

This creates tight \ncoupling between the application and the specifiic data representation chosen\nand is a lot less flexible than a database. Also, as there is no good way to \nrepresent relations, there is a lot of redundancy and inconsistency as seen\nin the table above.\n2. ANSI SPARC\nThe ANSI SPARC model is a standard reference model for building a database. \nRoughly sketch its layers and their functions.\nThere are three layers in ANSI-SPARC:\n\n\nExternal Level:\nThis level shows only the relevant part for a user/application and \nexcludes unauthorized and irrelevant data.\n\n\nConceptual Level:\nThis level shows the whole database with all relations.\n\n\nInternal Level:\nThis level specifies the physical storage of the data.\n\n\n3. Benefits of databases\nA database built according to the ANSI SPARC model provides physical and logical \ndata independence. \nWhat does this mean?\nPhysical independence means that the Internal Level, meaning the physical\nrepresentation of the data on a storage medium, can be changed without the need\nfor a change in an application.\nLogical independence means that the Conceptual Level, meaning the\nrepresentation of all data in the DB, can be changed without affecting\napplications as long as the External Level can still be derived. \nWhich problems from task 1 does this solve?\nIt pretty solves the problem of inflexibility outlined in task 1. The logical \nindependence provides a lot of flexibility compared to a file based\nrepresentation of the data.\n4. Database lifecycle\nWhat are the phases of the DB lifecycle and what happens roughly in each \nphase?\nThe database lifecycle consists of five phases:\n\n\nRequirements Analysis:\nFind out who needs what data and in which quality.\n\n\nConceptual Design:\nSpecify the conceptual data model.\n\n\nLogical Design:\nSpecify the logical data model.\n\n\nPhysical Design:\nSpecify the internal data model.\n\n\nUsage, Maintenance and Reorganization:\nTune and adapt the database.\n\n\n5. Semantic modeling 1\nThe ornithologists' association 'Buntspecht' would like to learn more about the\npopulation of native birds. Therefore, it calls on interested people to observe\nbirds once a month for a limited period of time (e.g. for one hour) in a \nself-selected environment (at home, while hiking, etc.). These observations are\nto be stored (via a website) in a database. In the requirements analysis, the\nfollowing text about the bird domain has been created: \nPeople make observations. The first name, surname, address and\ndate of birth of each person should be stored. If available also the \nTelNr. and the eMail. Some persons are even members of the \nassociation.\nEach observation takes place on a certain day (e.g., on 15 February 2022) \nand in a certain period (e.g., from 13 to 14 h). The observation takes\nplace at a certain Austrian district and province and in a typical\nenvironment like, e.g., English garden, natural garden, forest, mountain or\ncity center. For each environment there is a short description.\nEach observation includes one or more bird species observed and the \nnumber of birds of that species seen (e.g., an observation on 16 January \n(11-13h) in Klagenfurt/Carinthia includes 2 bluebirds, 14 house sparrows and a\nnuthatch).\nEach bird species has a name, a scientific name and a description.\nSome bird species are migratory birds. Each bird species includes a brief\ndescription and a link to a website with more information. Each bird \nspecies also belongs to a family (for example, nuthatches belong to the\nSittidae family).\nBased on this text, create a semantic data model in the form of a UML class\ndiagram.\n\n6. Semantic modeling 2\nDoes your semantic data model from Task 6 include the information needed to do\nthis and if so, where can they be found?\nThe association 'Buntspecht' would like to make the following evaluations, \namong others:\n\n\nAll observations with the respective number per observed bird species.\nList all observations.\n\n\nWhen and where were there observations in a forest in Carinthia?\nList all observations and filter them by environment and district.\n\n\nIn which environment were the most magpies observed in Carinthia in October?\nList all observations, filter them by day and district. List all species for\nall those observations and look where the most magpies where observed.\n\n\nHow many greenfinches were observed in Klagenfurt in January?\nList all observations, filter them by day and province and add up all observed\ngreenfinches.\n\n\nWhat is the most observed species group observed in waterfront areas in the\ndistrict of Graz?\nList all observations, filter them by environment and district and add up all\nthe amounts for all observed species. Then take the maximum.\n\n\nWhich migratory bird species was observed most often in the district of\nVillach in May?\nList all observations, filter them by district and add up all the amounts for \nevery migratory species. Then take the maximum.\n\n\nWhat is the name of the smallest observed species of Sittidae?\nList all observations, add up all the amounts for every species which belongs \nto the family of sittidae. Then find the minimum and return this species.\n\n\nWhich persons donated how much to the association last year?\nList all persons and find the smallest donation.\n\n\nWhich individuals observed the most bird species last year?\nList all persons, add up all the different species in their observations and \nfind the maximum.\n\n\n","id":"https://courses.hilgers.dev/databases/exercise01/","title":"Exercise 01"},"https://courses.hilgers.dev/databases/exercise03/":{"body":"A new database is to be developed for the WinDBö bakery to support sales, room\nand personnel management and marketing. Discussions were held with responsible\npersons and future users, and existing information systems were analyzed. The\ntexts in the tasks summarize the most important requirements for the data to be\nstored as a result of the domain analysis. From this, model a semantic data\nmodel in the form of a UML diagram.\n1.\nThe database to be developed should contain data on products that the WinDBö\nbakery produces itself (e.g. Easter Reindling) or purchases (marzipan\nconfectionery). In any case, a product has a name and a category (e.g. bread,\ncake, pastry, confectionery). Furthermore, it must be possible to store the\nproduction price or the purchase price as well as the gross sales price for each\nproduct. It should also be possible to view the central warehouse stock for the\nproduct in the database. A product contains zero or more ingredients.\nIngredients are only stored in the database if they are contained in at least\none product. The name and allergens of the ingredients are known.\n\n2.\nWinDBö has several branches all over the country. For each branch, its address\nis to be stored in the database. Each branch has a unique branch number. In the\nbranches the products are stored and sold in a certain quantity. For each sale,\nthe date of sale and the invoice amount should be recorded. Each branch includes\nseveral rooms. Each room has a size in m2 and a purpose (e.g. sales, guest room,\nwarehouse, production).\n\n3.\nA sale includes one or more products in a certain quantity or number, which\nrepresent individual sales items of the sale. A product can be sold more often,\nof course (if the stock allows it). Gift baskets are special products consisting\nof at least five or more other products. The sales price of a gift basket may\ndiffer from the sum of the sales prices of its components and therefore it must\nbe stored separately in the DB. Also the weight of the gift basket and the\nnumber of products it contains must be recorded.\n\n4.\nA sale is always made by an employee of the store. The employee's employee\nnumber, first and last name, date of birth, home address (street, postal code,\ncity) and gross salary are known. An employee can handle several sales, but some\ndo not sell anything at all. This depends on the activity of the employee, which\nis also stored in the DB. Each employee has to perform exactly one specific\nactivity. Each employee receives an employee card upon employment. An employee\nID card is assigned to exactly one employee. The card number, authorization and\nexpiration date are stored on the card. If an employee is deleted from the\nsystem, the employee ID card should also be deleted.\n\n5.\nSometimes the customer of a sale is also known and should be saved. These\nregular customers have a customer card with a customer number and are credited\nwith bonus points for each purchase, which should be stored. From regular\ncustomers, in any case, the unique customer number, the first and last name, the\naddress and the date of birth is known. Sometimes also an e-mail, a Tel.Nr. and\ntheir consent to send the customer a newsletter is to be stored.\n\n6.\nSometimes employees also receive a commission for the sales they make. An\nemployee works in one branch at one time, but can also be employed by different\nbranches over time. This temporal development is to be stored in the DB. At\nleast one, but possibly several employees work in a branch. Employees can have\nsuperiors. Supervisors may have no employees or several employees. The bakery\nhas company cell phones, from which the model and phone number must be stored.\nSome employees are provided with a company cell phone, but not all are. This\nshould be managed with the help of the database.\n\n7.\nProvide 5 queries of interest to the bakery's marketing that can be answered\nbased on their semantic data model of the bakery (e.g., which products of the\ncategory 'cake' were sold in store F in March 2022 in a quantity above 5\npieces?).\n\nTotal invoice amount of all sales with customers who want to get the\nnewsletter.\nAll branches in which the employee 'John Doe' has ever worked in and sold a\nproduct for which he got a commission.\nThe names of all the supervisors who supervise employees which have an expired\ncard.\nThe average gross salary of employees with a company cellphone who have worked\nin at least 2 other branches before.\nThe total quantity of products sold by all employees supervised by 'John Doe'.\n\n","id":"https://courses.hilgers.dev/databases/exercise03/","title":"Exercise 03"},"https://courses.hilgers.dev/databases/exercise04/":{"body":"1.

Answer the following Questions\n1. What are data types, primitive data types and complex data types?\nData types define which values a variable can hold. Primitive data types are for \nexample int or char. Complex data types are composites of other data types and\nmethods.\n2. What is the principle of secrecy (think of data encapsulation)? What is the meaning of private and public in this context?\nThe principle of secrecy refers to the user not having to know anything about\nthe inner workings of an Item to use it. The modifiers public and private restrict\nthe access to classes, methods, etc. to only specific contexts. public means that\nusage is not restricted while private means that for example a method can only\nbe called from the class itself.\n3. What is method overloading?\nMethod overloading refers to the act of specifying a method with the same name\nfor multiple different inputs. It is important that the method signature differs.\n4. What are generics and their use cases?\nGenerics are a way to reuse the same implementations for multiple data types. They\nare commonly used to implement data structures which do not care about what data they\noperate on (like ArrayList) or data structures which can reuse implementations for \nmany similar types implementing a specific interface (like Comparable).\n5. What are static variables/methods?\nStatic variables and methods are shared between all objects of a specific class and\ncan be used from the class itself without even referring to an object of it.\n2.

The order of the numbers in the list should be persisted and a new list\nwithout duplicates should be returned.\nMore information about ArrayList can be found in the \n\nAlso write a small program (main method) to test your implementation.\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class Task3 {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        int[] array1 = new int[]{1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3};\n        int[] array2 = new int[]{7, 5, 3, 5, 1};\n        int[] array3 = new int[]{1, 1, 1, 1};\n\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list1 = arrayToList(array1);\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list2 = arrayToList(array2);\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list3 = arrayToList(array3);\n\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; dedup1 = removeDups(list1);\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; dedup2 = removeDupsWithStream(list2);\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; dedup3 = removeDupsWithStream(list3);\n\n        System.out.println(dedup1);\n        System.out.println(dedup2);\n        System.out.println(dedup3);\n    }\n\n    private static ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arrayToList(int[] array) {\n        return new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.stream(array).boxed().toList());\n    }\n\n    private static ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; removeDupsWithStream(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {\n        return list.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));\n    }\n\n    private static ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; removeDups(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list) {\n        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        for (int i : list) {\n            if (!l.contains(i)) l.add(i);\n        }\n        return l;\n    }\n}\n\n4. Comparison of native Array and object-based ArrayList\nIn the following example, we want to compare the performance between an\nobject-based ArrayList and a native array. Which do you think will be faster?\n1. Implement a method to generate a random array\nImplement the method private static int[] generateTestData(int size), which \nreturns an array of randomized integer numbers. The size of the array is determined\nby the given parameter. To generate random numbers you can use the class java.util.Random.\nprivate static int[] generateTestData(long size) {\n    return new Random().ints(size).toArray();\n}\n\n2. Write a method to sort an array\nWrite the method private static void sort(int[] inputData) which sorts the\ngiven array of numbers in ascending order. Use the BubbleSort algorithm for that purpose.\nprivate static void sort(int[] inputData) {\n    for (int i = 0; bubbleSortSinglePass(inputData, inputData.length - i); i++);\n}\n\nprivate static boolean bubbleSortSinglePass(int[] input, int right) {\n    boolean swapped = false;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; right - 1; i++) {\n        if (input[i] &gt; input[i + 1]) {\n    \tswapped = true;\n    \tswap(input, i, i + 1);\n        }\n    }\n    return swapped;\n}\n\nprivate static void swap(int[] input, int i, int j) {\n    int temp = input[i];\n    input[i] = input[j];\n    input[j] = temp;\n}\n\n3. Overload the sorting method to sort ArrayList objects.\nprivate static void sort(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; inputData) {\n    int[] temp = inputData.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();\n    inputData.clear();\n    sort(temp);\n    inputData.addAll(Arrays.stream(temp).boxed().toList());\n}\n\n4. Benchmark the two methods and compare the results.\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\n    System.out.println(\"+++++++++Native Array v.s. ArrayList performance test+++++++++\");\n    \n    //Fill Array with test data\n    int[] testDataArray = generateTestData(10000);\n    \n    //Fill ArrayList with the same test data\n    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; testDataArrayList = IntStream.of(testDataArray)\n    \t\t.boxed()\n    \t\t.collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));\n    \n    long timeElapsed;\n    \n    //Do test for Array\n    timeElapsed = benchmark(() -&gt; sort(testDataArray));\n    System.out.println(\"Time elapsed sorting Array: \"+timeElapsed+\" Milliseconds\");\n    \n    //Do test for ArrayList\n    timeElapsed = benchmark(() -&gt; sort(testDataArrayList));\n    System.out.println(\"Time elapsed sorting ArrayList: \"+timeElapsed+\" Milliseconds\");\n}\n\nprivate static long benchmark(Runnable r) {\n    long testStart = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    r.run();\n    long testEnd = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    \n    return testEnd - testStart;\n}\n\nSurprisingly, even through the method for sorting the ArrayList has to convert\nthe list to an array and then call the other method, both take the same time to\nexecute (around 90ms for 10000 elements).\n","id":"https://courses.hilgers.dev/oom-and-oop/exercise01/","title":"Exercise 01"},"https://courses.hilgers.dev/oom-and-oop/exercise02/":{"body":"1. Answer the following Questions.\n1. How do objects and classes differ and how do they relate to each other?\nA class is a blueprint from which you create instances, objects are the \ninstances created from a class.\n2. How do variables and methods differ between objects and classes?\nThere is a difference between class variables and instance variables. Class\nvariables are shared by all objects and can be accessed through the class \nitself. Instance variables are unique for each instance of the class and can\nonly be accessed from an instance of the class. Similar principles apply to\nmethods. Static methods can be accessed through the class itself while others\ncan only be called on objects.\n3. What are constructors, how are they marked and what are they used for?\nConstructors are used to create a new object. They are marked through having \nthe same name as the class.\n4. What is the usual return value of a constructor?\nThe return value of a constructor is an object of the class.\n5. Does each class have a constructor?\nYes, even if no constructor is declared explicitly, the class has a so called\ndefault constructor which takes no argument and returns a new object of the \nclass with all instance variables set to their respective default value.\n6. What is the meaning of null?\nThe keyword null can be used for all complex data types to indicate that the\nvariable does not refer to any object or array.\n7. What does the keyword this mean?\nThe this keyword is used to explicitly access instance variables of the \ncurrent object.\n2. Hardware Class\n\n\n1. Variables\nWrite a class Hardware, which represents a hardware part in a PC. The\nclass should contain the following instance variables:\nprivate String id\nprivate String name\n\n\n\n2.

Answer the following questions.\n1. Why are inheritance hierarchies built between classes? What are the advantages?\nInheritance hierarchies are mainly built to maximize code reuse. If one has, \nlike in the examples below, a way to model Hardware, then we can reuse the\ncode and extend it for more specific types or Hardware like CPU and RAM.\n2. Is a constructor of the superclasses always called as soon as a new object of a subclass is created?\nThe default constructor is always called implicitly, unless the default \nconstructor does not exist and another constructor is defined.\n3. When must the constructor of the superclass be called explicitly?\nWhen the superclass defines a constructor with parameters, then this \nconstructor has to be called explicitly\n4. What does 'overriding' mean, i.e. overriding a method?\nOverriding a method refers to changing the behaviour of a method without \nchanging the signature. This is typically done in subclasses to change the\nbehaviour of the methods defined in the superclass.\n5. How can methods of the superclass be called explicitly even if they have been overridden?\nOne has to call those methods with a special keyword called super.\n6. What are internal classes?\nInternal classes are classes defined inside another class.\n2. CPU class with inheritance\nWrite a class CPU that inherits from the class Hardware from exercise 02. The \nclass CPU extends hardware with information about its speed and the number of\ncores.\n\nImplement the appropriate instance variables and a constructor for\ninitialization.\nThe inherited method public String getInfo() should be overwritten and\nreturn both the inherited and the new information as a string.\n\npublic class CPU extends Hardware {\n\n    private final double clockSpeed;\n    private final int numberOfCores;\n\n    public CPU(String id, String name, double clockSpeed, int numberOfCores) {\n        super(id, name);\n        this.clockSpeed = clockSpeed;\n        this.numberOfCores = numberOfCores;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getInfo() {\n        return super.getInfo()\n            + \", clock speed: \" + clockSpeed\n            + \", number of cores: \" + numberOfCores;\n    }\n}\n\n3. Memory, Ram and Harddisk classes with inheritance\n1. Memory\nAnalogous to task 2, write a class Memory that in turn inherits from Hardware.\nFor Memory, the size as well as the average read speed are of interest. Don not\nforget to overwrite getInfo() again accordingly.\npublic class Memory extends Hardware {\n\n    private final double sizeInGB;\n    private final double readSpeedInMbit;\n\n    public Memory(String id, String name, double sizeInGB, double readSpeedInMbit) {\n        super(id, name);\n\n        this.sizeInGB = sizeInGB;\n        this.readSpeedInMbit = readSpeedInMbit;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getInfo() {\n        return super.getInfo()\n            + \", size in GB: \" + sizeInGB\n            + \", read speed in Mbit \" + readSpeedInMbit;\n    }\n}\n\n2. RAM and Harddisk\nRealize the classes RAM and Harddisk, which inherit from Memory. You can provide\nadditional information for these classes in the form of instance variables, if\nyou wish.\npublic class RAM extends Memory {\n    public RAM(String id, String name, double sizeInGB, double readSpeedInMbit) {\n        super(id, name, sizeInGB, readSpeedInMbit);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Harddisk extends Memory {\n    public Harddisk(String id, String name, double sizeInGB, double readSpeedInMbit) {\n        super(id, name, sizeInGB, readSpeedInMbit);\n    }\n}\n\n4. Graphics class with internal Resolution\nAs in Task 2, implement a class Graphics which inherits from Hardware and\nrepresents a graphics card. A graphics card can support different resolutions\n(e.g. 800X600, 1024X768, etc.). \nFor a resolution mode an internal class Resolution is to be defined inside\nthe class Graphics which manages information about a certain horizontal and\nvertical resolution.\nGraphics then manages a list (e.g. ArrayList) of resolutions which stores the\ndifferent resolutions supported by the graphics card.\nDo not forget to overwrite getInfo() again accordingly.\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\npublic class Graphics extends Hardware {\n    private record Resolution(int horizontal, int vertical) {\n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return \"{ horizontal: %s, vertical: %s }\".formatted(horizontal, vertical);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private final ArrayList&lt;Resolution&gt; resolutions;\n\n    public Graphics(String id, String name) {\n        super(id, name);\n\n        this.resolutions = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    }\n\n    public void addResolution(int horizontal, int vertical) {\n        resolutions.add(new Resolution(horizontal, vertical));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getInfo() {\n        return super.getInfo()\n            + \", supported resolutions: [\"\n            + resolutions.stream()\n                    .map(Resolution::toString)\n                    .collect(Collectors.joining(\", \")) + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n\n","id":"https://courses.hilgers.dev/oom-and-oop/exercise03/","title":"Exercise 03"},"https://courses.hilgers.dev/oom-and-oop/exercise04/":{"body":"1. Answer the following questions.\n1. What is polymorphism?\nPolymorphism means that an object of a specific class can also be treated as an\nobject of the type of all their parent classes and also just be treated like \nall the interfaces it implements.\n2. What is dynamic binding?\nDynamic binding means that the method call is resolved at runtime.\n3. What are abstract classes?\nAbstract classes which can compared to interfaces already implement functions \nand create variables but cannot be instantiated directly. They have to be\nextended and all their abstract methods have to be implemented from the\nsubclass.\n4. What are the properties of an abstract method?\nAn abstract method has to be implemented in a subclass.\n5. Can an abstract method be private?\nYes it can.\n6. What does the keyword 'final' mean in the context of inheritance hirarchies?\nFinal means that the class can not be extended.\n2. Dynamic Binding\nHave a look at the following java code snippet:\npublic String getHardwareInfo(){\n    String allInfo = \"Hardware in this PC: \";\n    for (Hardware hardwarePart : hardwareParts) {\n        allInfo = allInfo + \"\\n\" + hardwarePart.getInfo();\n    }\n    return allInfo;\n}\n\nIn this method getInfo does not execute the code from the Hardware class, but\ninstead executes the code of the overridden methods even though we declare the\ntype as Hardware and not as the specific subclasses.\nHow is this behaviour called?\nThis behaviour is called dynamic binding.\n3. Reflection and Typecasting\nIn the PC class, write a small public void test() method that iterates over \nthe installed hardware parts and calls a method for each installed part, which \nhas not been overridden (e.g. a getter method with additional information).\npublic void test() {\n    for (Hardware h : hardwareParts) {\n        if (h instanceof Memory) {\n            Memory m = (Memory) h;\n            System.out.println(m.getSizeInGB());\n            System.out.println(m.getReadSpeedInMbit());\n        } else if (h instanceof CPU) {\n            CPU c = (CPU) h;\n            System.out.println(c.getClockSpeed());\n            System.out.println(c.getNumberOfCores());\n        } else if (h instanceof Graphics) {\n            Graphics g = (Graphics) h;\n            System.out.println(g.getResolutions());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYou will need to use explicit typecasts and possibly the instanceof operator\noperator. \nWhy are these steps necessary?\nThese methods are not defined for the Superclass Hardware so we have to \ndynamically find out the type of an object to call their respective methods.\n4. Abstract Classes\n\n\nWhich classes from exercise two and three can or should be abstract and how\nwould that restrict the usage of those classes?\nThe two classes Hardware and Memory can and should be abstract, because \nit does not make sense to instantiate them directly.\n\n\nCan you also find usecases for abstract methods?\nNot really, as the Hardware class can already define the output of the ID\nand the name.\n\n\nWhat do subclasses of abstract classes have to do with regard to abstract \nmethods?\nAbstract methods have to be overridden.\n\n\n","id":"https://courses.hilgers.dev/oom-and-oop/exercise04/","title":"Exercise 04"},"https://courses.hilgers.dev/oom-and-oop/exercise05/":{"body":"1.

Alternatively, the interfaces can be can\nalso be generated from the respective implementation classes (see below).\nWrite a suitable implementation class that implements the respective interface\nand extends the class Hardware of the previous exercise sheets.\nA scanner works with an internal instance variable numOfScans, which counts the\nnumber of scans performed. If the scan() method is called, this variable is\nincremented by one. With reset() it is reset to zero.\nA printer works in a similar way with the internal instance variables inkLevel\nand numOfPrints. If the method print() is called, inkLevel is decreased by one\nand numOfPrints is increased by one. With reset() numOfPrints is reset to\nzero, inkLevel is not affected, it is set if necessary with the corresponding\nsetter-method if necessary.\nDon't forget to override the method getInfo(), so that analogous to the\nprevious exercise sheets, all information about a device is output.\npublic class Printer extends Hardware implements PrinterI {\n\n    private int inkLevel;\n    private int numOfPrints;\n\n    public Printer(String id, String name) {\n        super(id, name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void reset() {\n        numOfPrints = 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void print() {\n        inkLevel--;\n        numOfPrints++;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getNumOfPrints() {\n        return numOfPrints;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setNumOfPrints(int numOfPrints) {\n        this.numOfPrints = numOfPrints;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getInkLevel() {\n        return inkLevel;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setInkLevel(int inkLevel) {\n        this.inkLevel = inkLevel;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getInfo() {\n        return \"{ inkLevel: %d, numOfPrints: %d }\".formatted(inkLevel, numOfPrints);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Scanner extends Hardware implements ScannerI {\n\n    private int numOfScans;\n\n    public Scanner(String id, String name) {\n        super(id, name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void reset() {\n        numOfScans = 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void scan() {\n        numOfScans++;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getNumOfScans() {\n        return numOfScans;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setNumOfScans(int numOfScans) {\n        this.numOfScans = numOfScans;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getInfo() {\n        return \"{ numOfScans: %d }\".formatted(numOfScans);\n    }\n\n}\n\nTask 4\nBased on Task 3, implement a Copier class that is both a scanner and a\nprinter.
